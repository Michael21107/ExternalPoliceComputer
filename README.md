# ExternalPoliceComputer 1.3.0

A Police Computer Plugin and Server for LSPDFR.

## Config

- File: `EPC/config.json`
- `useStopThePed`: If set to `true` and STP is installed, EPC will use registration and insurance data generated by STP; If set to `false`, EPC will generate registration and insurance data (resulting in different results)
- `useLSPDFROwner`: If set to `true`, EPC will use the owner of a vehicle generated by LSPDFR (resulting in the owner possibly coming back as not found when searching); If set to `false`, EPC will generate the owner of a vehicle (resulting in different results)
- `wordForJail`: EPC will use this word for jail (e.g. if you prefer prison)
- `currency`: EPC will use this currency
- `showCurrentID`: If set to `true`, EPC will show the ID of peds you ask, arrest or ped down; I recommend you set this to `false` on most mobile devices
- `autoShowCurrentID`: If set to `true`, IDs will pop up automatically; If set to `false`, you'll have the option to show/hide the current ID
- `warningColorsForPedCarSearch`: If set to `true`, expired registration/insurance, outstanding warrants, etc. will be displayed in a warning color
- If you create your own `custom.js` file, you may add variables here (path: `/data/config`)
